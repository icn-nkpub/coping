__The Score__ is counting your progress in general. No matter how hard it is to quit now, it's worth doing, and this score shows how hard it's for you. Everyone is a different person with different life situations and dependency stories. And when you quit: a big score will indicate how hard your work was on this topic. There are no issues with the long way to finish. There are issues with not trying.
